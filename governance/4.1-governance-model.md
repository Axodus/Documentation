# 4.1 Governance model

Our governance will follow a model of checks and balances; that is, all decisions must be voted through a balanced structure between the participants of three groups. The groups are: Core DEV, Boardroom, and Community DAO.

This system aims at greater security in decision-making regarding changes in the proportionality of investment, use of the treasury, and any decision that requires consultation between the shareholders to proceed.
