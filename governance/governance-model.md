# 4.1 Governance model

Our governance will follow a model of checks and balances; that is, all decisions must be voted through a balanced structure between the participants of three groups. The groups are: Core DEV, Boardroom, and Community DAO.

This system aims at greater security in decision-making regarding changes in the proportionality of investment, use of the treasury, and any decision that requires consultation between the shareholders to proceed.

### How DAOÂ´s works&#x20;

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a type of organization that is run using smart contracts on a blockchain network. DAOs are designed to operate independently, without the need for central authorities or intermediaries.

A DAO is made up of a group of people who come together to achieve a common goal, such as the development of a new project or the management of a shared pool of assets. Each member of the DAO has a say in how the organization is run and can vote on proposals and make decisions.

A DAO is governed by a set of smart contracts that specify the rules and regulations of the organization, such as how members can join, how proposals are made and voted on, and how funds are managed. These smart contracts are stored on the blockchain and are automatically executed when certain conditions are met.

One of the key features of a DAO is that it is decentralized, meaning that there is no central point of control or decision-making. Instead, all members of the DAO have an equal say in how the organization is run. This helps ensure transparency and fairness in the decision-making process.

It's important to note that DAOs are relatively new, and the concept is still being developed and refined. It's important to conduct thorough research and consider the risks before investing in or joining a DAO.
