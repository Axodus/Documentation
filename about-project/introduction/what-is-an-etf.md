# What is an ETF

An ETF holds a collection of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, and the value of the ETF is determined by the value of the underlying assets it holds. This allows investors to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets without having to buy individual stocks or bonds.

ETFs have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their flexibility and low cost. They can be bought and sold like individual stocks, and can be included in a diversified investment portfolio. ETFs are also popular due to the low cost of management and the ease of trading.

It's important to note that the returns on ETFs are not guaranteed, and the value of an ETF can go up or down depending on the performance of the underlying assets. As with any investment, it's important to conduct thorough research and consider your own financial situation before investing in an ETF.
