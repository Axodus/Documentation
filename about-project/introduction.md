# Introduction

Axodus is born with the goal of bringing all the financial potential of the market defi to every investor, from the most experienced to the one that is starting. Our goal is bold. We want to establish a new paradigm in the decentralized financial market.&#x20;

For this desire to be viable for everyone, there is no other way to follow if it is not the total transparency and solid information that will serve as north for all involved in this project. Throughout this documentation we will scrutinize every detail and you will realize that you are facing something truly differentiated. Be aware that you are not here to be harassed with illusions.&#x20;

We will not promise you to apply illusory or short -term wealth, although this may be possible. This will prove as the most appropriate way to follow, as we will not work in the capital distribution system (as is done in virtually all projects), but in profit distribution.&#x20;

This is exactly why we will not offer the illusion of unsustainable APR. Team of selected PROFESSIONALS will be ahead of this investment system, very similar to an DaaS (defi as a service) in ETF format for dividend payment.
