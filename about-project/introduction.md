# Introduction

Axodus is born with the goal of bringing all the financial potential of the decentralized market to every investor, from the most experienced to the one that is starting. Our goal is bold. We want to establish a new paradigm in the decentralized financial market.&#x20;

For this desire to be viable and appealing for everyone, there is one key tenent we will follow: total transparency at all times, in all things. We know that any economy and currency is only as strong as the faith of its participants; we will never leave room for any doubt. Throughout this documentation we will scrutinize every detail of our project and you will realize that you are facing something truly differentiated. Be aware that you are not here to be harassed with illusions or false promises.&#x20;

Although we will not promise you illusory or short-term wealth, this may be possible. Our goals are long term and we believe this aligns with what most investors are looking for: safety, transparency, and healthy growth. We intend to achieve this through a profit distribution system as opposed to a capital distribution system (as is done in virtually all projects, and often leads to unproffesional and questionable management of investor funds).&#x20;

This is exactly why we will not offer the illusion of unsustainable APR. Our team of selected PROFESSIONALS will be in charge of this investment system, very similar to a DaaS (defi as a service) in ETF format for dividend payment.
