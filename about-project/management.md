# Management

All project management, from administrative executions to investment definitions, is the full responsibility of the entire community. For this to work properly, there needs to be a balanced system of powers and balances. Here we will present the idea summarized, and you will be able to deepen your understanding later in the other sections of this document.

### Tripartite administration:

Executive team: Professionals responsible for the determination and execution of actions;&#x20;

Boardroom: Executives entitled to a seat on the board with voting rights. Investors with at least 2.5% of the company are automatically appointed to the boardroom and are subject to a hearing by the other directors for approval.&#x20;

Community: The community will hold the treasure key. This means that all actions proposed by the project executives must be voted on by the community and endorsed. The community must elect its executive representatives (DAO) who will be the majority of signatories of the treasury portfolio, which will be decisive for the release or not of the money to be applied/executed by the project administration.
