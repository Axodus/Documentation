# 1.3.3 Dividends

Profits created by the work of our professionals will be converted into STABLECOIN and added to an income portfolio. These yields will be divided into 30% for the treasury, adding value to the ETF title, and 70% paid directly to the holders, which can be withdrawn and used according to the investor's desire.
