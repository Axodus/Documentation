# 1.4.3 Exchangeable debentures

Exchangeable debentures are those in which the person investing chooses to receive shares or assets of the company as payment.

For example, those who invest can choose to acquire a number of shares corresponding to the value of their investment in debentures plus interest.

However, it is only possible to exchange exchangeable debentures for shares or securities of the same company that issued them, and not of third parties.
