# 1.4.1 Debentures convertible into shares

This type of debenture can be converted into shares within a specified period or at the end of the bond's validity period, hence the name convertible.

Also, it is possible that the security has a clause that allows the exchange for assets or shares of third parties. However, all these conditions must be included in the purchase agreement.

The conversion of a debenture into shares will occur on the previously established day, or when the application expires.
