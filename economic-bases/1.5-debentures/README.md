What is a Debenture?

Debentures are debt securities or investments. It is a kind of loan for companies that issue them.

They are a fixed Income investment with the potential for good return. Debentures can be an excellent option for any portfolio, especially for those seeking diversification..

* A company needs a certain amount of money to invest in business expansion or even pay off debts.
* Instead of looking for a loan at the bank (with higher costs), it launches debentures on the market to raise funds.
* A person who is interested can buy a debenture and, in return, receive interest on the money invested in the company. Basically, it is as if the person who invested became a creditor of the company, that is, the company would be in debt to him.
