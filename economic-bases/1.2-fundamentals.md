# 1.2 Fundamentals

We aim at capital protection above all else.

Most of the treasury will be invested in Stable Pools, such as 3pool curve, lending in STABLE and any and all possibilities of this nature.

Another important part of the treasury will be invested in Validators in the main networks of the crypto space. As this type of investment is inevitably exposed to market fluctuations, we will hedge this exposure in the futures market and/or options.

Only a small part of the treasury will be exposed to risk by investing in ecosystem projects.

All profit obtained with validators and stable pools will then also be reinvested in ecosystem projects in DaaS format, thus putting only profitability at risk.

The result of this DaaS investment structure will result in PROFITABILITY to be converted into stable using the existing DEX and distributed between holders and treasury proportionally.
