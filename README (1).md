# Introduction

Axodus was born with the goal of bringing all the financial potential of the decentralised market to every investor, from the most experienced to the fresh beginner. Our goal is bold. We want to establish a new paradigm in the decentralised financial market.

For this desire to be viable and appealing for everyone, there is one key tenet we will follow: total transparency at all times, in all things. We know that any economy and currency is only as strong as the faith of its participants; we will never leave room for any doubt. Throughout this documentation we will scrutinise every detail of our project and you will realise that you are facing something truly differentiated. Be aware that you are not here to be harassed with illusions or false promises of short-term wealth.

Our goals are long term and we believe this aligns with what most investors are looking for: safety, transparency, and healthy growth. We intend to achieve this through a profit distribution system as opposed to a capital distribution system (as is done in virtually all projects, and often leads to unprofessional and questionable management of investor funds).

This is exactly why we will not offer the illusion of unsustainable APR. Our team of selected PROFESSIONALS will be in charge of this investment system, very similar to a DaaS (defi as a service) in ETF format for dividend payment.
